# Purple Thing!

A game for Ludum Dare 46 (theme: Keep it Alive).  A mini-platformer in which
you must toss around a fragile purple creature to get it to the end of the
level safely.

I feel like you could make a pretty interesting platforming experience using
similar mechanics but with better level design & better physics.
