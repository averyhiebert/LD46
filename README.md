A game for Ludum Dare 46.

## Concept:
- side-scrolling platformer.
- You carry an animal on your head.
- You can throw it, but you have to catch it again.
  - will need a double-tap mechanic to rush to under the animal's position.
- You can only defend yourself when not holding the animal.
- Throw it in order to go through narrow tunnels etc.
- There is a twist at the end.
