# Ludum Dare Game (Title not yet chosen).

A game for Ludum Dare 46.

## Concept:
- side-scrolling platformer.
- You carry an animal on your head.
- You can throw it, but you have to catch it again.
  - will need a double-tap mechanic to rush to under the animal's position.
- You can only defend yourself when not holding the animal.
- Throw it in order to go through narrow tunnels etc.
- There is a twist at the end.

## Obstacle ideas:
- Ground enemy you must stab
- Diving bird - throw the animal over it as it dives.
- Spiky obstacle only you can fit under - need to throw puffball over
- Tunnel only you can fit in to push button - must throw puffball, go in and
    hit button, and come back out to catch puffball.
- Throw animal to hit a button?
- Some sort of trampoline?
- Maybe you have to throw the ball but catch it before it hits a wall?
- Maybe also a basketball hoop somewhere?
